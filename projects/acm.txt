Another challenge was managing the scope of the projectâ€”feature requests and evolving priorities required the team to stay agile while maintaining a clear development path. We also had to coordinate work across multiple modules, making integration between the React frontend and the backend services complex at times. Ensuring consistency in code quality and managing merge conflicts in a team setting tested our collaborative and technical skills."}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold p-5 md:py-10 lg:mx-40","children":"Tools Used"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row items-center px-5 lg:mx-40","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-row gap-6","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex flex-col items-center","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://react.dev/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/portfolio/React.png","alt":"React","className":"w-12 h-12 object-contain hover:scale-105 transition-transform"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300","children":"React"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex flex-col items-center","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://git-scm.com/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/portfolio/Git.png","alt":"Git","className":"w-12 h-12 object-contain hover:scale-105 transition-transform"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300","children":"Git"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex flex-col items-center","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/portfolio/Github.jpg","alt":"Github","className":"w-12 h-12 object-contain hover:scale-105 transition-transform"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300","children":"Github"}]]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold p-5 md:py-10 lg:mx-40","children":"Resources"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"px-10 lg:mx-40 hover:text-blue-400 list-disc","children":["$","li",null,{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/ky06134/openSourceSpring23","target":"_blank","children":"GitHub Repo"}]}]}]]}]]}],["$","$L6",null,{"children":"$L7"}],null,["$","$L8",null,{"children":["$L9","$La",["$","$Lb",null,{"promise":"$@c"}]]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$1","PApqr3F2W4d3e-C0liqSu",{"children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"children":"$Le"}],null]}],null]}],false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$f","$undefined"],"s":false,"S":true}
